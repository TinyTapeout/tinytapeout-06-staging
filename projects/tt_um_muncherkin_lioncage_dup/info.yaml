  description: Count up to 15 lions, moving through a tunnel between a cage and an
    enclosure.

  how_it_works: "Two sensors are set in the tunnel. The sensor closest to the cage\
    \ is G1,\nthe other G2. Only one lion can walk through the tunnel at a time. A\
    \ lion \nis allowed to reverse in the tunnel. \n\nAs the lion starts walking out,\
    \ (G1, G2) = (1, 0), the counter increments by 1.\nOne of two scenarios then occurs:\
    \ either the sensors read (G1, G2) = (0, 0) before it \nreads (G1, G2) = (0, 1).\
    \ In that case, the counter will decrement as the lion must have gone \nback into\
    \ the cage. Otherwise, the sensors will read (G1, G2) = (0, 1) before it reads\
    \ \n(G1, G2) = (0, 0), thereby letting us know that it has passed (G1, G2) = (1,\
    \ 1) as well. The \ncounter will not change in this case.\n\nIf we read (G1, G2)\
    \ = (1, 1) before reading (G1, G2) = (1, 0), we know a lion is moving from the\
    \ \nenclosure to the cage. We then repeat the above two cases. This allows us\
    \ to create a two \nstate graph of the problem, transitioning from S0 to S1 on\
    \ either (G1, G2) = (1, 0) or\n(G1, G2) = (1, 1) and returning back on (G1, G2)\
    \ = (0, 1) or (G1, G2) = (0, 0), incrementing \nthe counter if S0->S1 on (G1,\
    \ G2) = (1, 0) and decrementing the counter if S1->S0 on \n(G1, G2) = (0, 0).\n"
  how_to_test: "After reset, the counter should increase by 1 if a lion moves from\
    \ the cage to the enclosure, and the opposite if \nvice versa.\n"
