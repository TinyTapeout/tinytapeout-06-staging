  how_to_test: "The synth is controlled by writing to its configuration registers:\n\
    \  - Keep the write strobe low when not writing\n  - Set the 4 bit write address,\
    \ and an 8 bit data value\n  - While keeping the address and data stable, bring\
    \ the write strobe high and then low again\n      - The write address and data\
    \ are sampled at 2-10 cycles after the rising edge of the write strobe\n\nThe\
    \ output comes in two forms:\n  - As a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal.\n \
    \ - As an 8 bit value on the 8 output pins, that can be reconstructed using a\
    \ resistor ladder.\n\nThe PWM signal should be simpler to use, but be sure reduce\
    \ the voltage with a resistive divider or similar\nbefore connecting it to an\
    \ audio device.\n**Note:Make sure that you know what you are doing when connecting\
    \ an audio device to the output.\nDon't apply more than 1 V between the terminals\
    \ of an audio plug this connected to line in.\n5 V direct from the chip might\
    \ damage your audio device.**\n\nTODO: Register descriptions\n"
