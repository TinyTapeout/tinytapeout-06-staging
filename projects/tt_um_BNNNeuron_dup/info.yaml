  description: a single neuron in a Binarized Neural Network (BNN), performing binary
    multiplication with XNOR, accumulation, and sign activation.

  how_it_works: 'This model simulates the behavior of a single neuron within a Binarized
    Neural Network (BNN)


    The XNOR operation is used to perform binary multiplication.

    A 32-bit signal used for accumulating the results of multiple XNOR operations,
    simulating the weighted sum of inputs.


    "Sign activation function" applies to the accumulated result.

    It maps the accumulated value to either +1 or -1 based on the sign.

  how_to_test: 'Reset the circuit to set to 0.

    The constant Input and weight is provided with enable signal to begin XNOR multiplication
