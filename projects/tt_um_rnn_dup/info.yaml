  how_it_works: 'Apply an input current to an RNN hidden state, where the hidden state
    will multiply with a 8x8 matrix.

    '
  how_to_test: 'After reset, the hidden state will be set to 0.


    Then change the inputs to change the current. You can read the output current
    to know the result.
