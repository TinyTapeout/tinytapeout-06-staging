  how_it_works: 'Start by applying an input current injection to the LIF neuron.


    This gets added to a membrane potential which decays by a factor beta over time.


    When the membrane potential exceeds the threshold, a spike is triggered.

    '
  how_to_test: 'Reset the circuit to set the membrane potential to 0.


    The inputs can be changed to vary the current. A higher current will result in
    a

    higher spike rate.
