  how_it_works: 'A spike is generated if the difference between the current and previous
    data inputs is greater than a specified input threshold. The design is meant to
    mimic the implementation of delta modulation in the [snnTorch](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.spikegen.html#snntorch.spikegen.delta)
    python package. Each clock cycle is treated as an input/output, therefore there
    can be consecutive spikes that appear to be constantly high.


    The input parameter, `off_spike`, enables spike generation when negative threshold
    is exceeded. A negative spike is represented by `spike[1] = 0`. A positive spike
    is represented by `spike[0] = 1`.


    All numerical inputs and outputs are unsigned 4-bit integers. You are able to
    (1) input the `data` value, the input (2) the `threshold` for a spike to be generated,
    and (3) a value for the previous register for debugging.


    The previous data register is included to be facilitate debugging with the ability
    to read the current value in the register and force the register to a specific
    value.

  how_to_test: 'The module is intended to have a digital input, such as an ADC with
    a parallel output that is directly fed into the `data` input with a shared `clk`
    signal. The `threshold` is meant to be tied to a constant value. The module outputs
    through `spikes` net.


    For simpler testing, the input does not need to be matched to the `clk`. With
    the `threshold` set, `data` can be changed and spikes can be viewed on an oscilloscope.
