  description: Given input current, spike when threshold is reached (also assume any
    files with the letters LFI should be LIF)

  how_it_works: 'Based on input current, calculation is made using it and previous
    membrane potential.

    If current membrane potential is above pre-set threshold then spike!

    '
  how_to_test: 'After reset, input some current and see what happens. Should see an
    increase on output and possibly a spike eventually.


    A current input of 100 after 20 cycles should produce a spike.

    '
  inputs:
  - clk_i is the clock
  - current_i is the current input to the LFI neuron
  - rst_n is for reset
  language: Verilog
  outputs:
  - nu_o is the next membrane potential
  - spike_o is the single bit to show when the neuron is firing
