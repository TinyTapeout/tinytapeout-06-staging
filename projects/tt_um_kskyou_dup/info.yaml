  description: Calculates the continued fraction of the square root of a natural number

  how_it_works: "This continued fraction calculator computes the convergents in the\
    \ standard manner. It computes the coefficients of the continued fraction, and\
    \ then recursively computes the convergents. \nIt turns out that when the target\
    \ is the square of a natural number, one can avoid the need of comparisons or\
    \ taking the floor (except on the first step) and only use addition, multiplication,\
    \ and integer division. \nStill, squeezing the design in roughly 1000 cells proved\
    \ quite difficult, and various simplifications were necessary (such as changing\
    \ the output from 7-segment to binary). \n\nThis calculator, in conjunction with\
    \ a mobile phone calculator, or paper and pencil, can be used to calculate the\
    \ fundumental solution of Pell's equation x^2 - Dy^2 = 1. To do this, simply\n\
    enter D, compute convergents, and verify whether the convergents satisfy Pell's\
    \ equation P^2 - DQ^2 = 1. The first convergents that satisfy Pell's equation\
    \ is the fundumental solution. \nThis procedure combines the continued fraction\
    \ calculator's ability to store various intermediate values and a mobile phone\
    \ calculator's ability to calculate large numbers. \n"
  how_to_test: "Enter 14 bit binary number D input via switches, press button 0 to\
    \ generate the next convergents P and Q, where sqrt(D) ~ P/Q.\nPress button 1\
    \ to read through the values of P and Q in order of P[15:8], P[7:0], Q[15:8],\
    \ Q[7:0]. \n"
