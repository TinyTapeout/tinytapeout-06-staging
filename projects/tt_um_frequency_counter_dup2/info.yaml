  - count period bit 05 or debug edge  bit 0
  - count period bit 04 or debug clock bit 2
  - count period bit 03 or debug clock bit 1
  - count period bit 02 or debug clock bit 0
  - count period bit 01 or debug state bit 1
  - count period bit 00 or debug state bit 0

  how_it_works: 'Debounces the input signal and counts how many transistions occur
    in a given period. A state machine

    then divides the count by ten by repeatedly subtracting ten and then displays
    the tens and units on the seven segment display.

    '
  how_to_test: 'Apply a signal to the signal input and the frequency will be measured
    and displayed on the seven segment. The dot is used to select between display
    tens and units.


    To change the count period (to get accurate counts), set it to match the clock
    frequency: clock_mhz * 100 - 1. So for a 10MHz clock, set to 999.

    Set the desired period (top 4 bits ui_in and all of uio_in) on the bidirectional
    inputs and toggle load input.


    To debug, enable debug mode and check the bidirectional outputs for state machine,
    clock count and edge count information.
