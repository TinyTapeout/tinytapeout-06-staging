  description: The design purpose is to evaluate, if metastability can be used as
    a true random number generator source in an ASIC design.

  how_it_works: "Generally a Flip Flop can enter a metastable state if the setup or\
    \ hold time is violated. In this design I try to reach this usually unwanted behaviour.\
    \  \nA toggle Flip Flop is used to create edges on the data inputs of the other\
    \ 2 Flip Flops. There are 2 modes: Manual and Auto. Manual mode uses the switch\
    \ on the PCB as trigger for one edge. \nAuto mode generates a cyclic trigger within\
    \ the ASIC. The data output of the toggle Flip Flop is connected to the next Flip\
    \ Flop by a programmable delay line. \nThe delay line is created by pairs of inverters.\
    \ The verilog keep attribute is necessary here, to avoid optimization during synthesis.\
    \ \nThe delay_ctrl input selects the number of inverters which are used as delay.\
    \ The number of inverters used is the delay_ctrl input value times 2. If you set\
    \ delay_ctrl to 1, 2 inverters are used. \nThe maximum number of inverters is\
    \ 128. After each state change of the toggle Flip Flop (exactly 3 clock cycles\
    \ after that) the output of all Flip Flops are compared. \nIn case the states\
    \ are different, metastability has occured.\n"
  how_to_test: 'For testing select the mode you want to try out. Set the mode to 0
    for auto mode and to 1 for manual mode.

    You can experiment with delay_ctrl input an try to produce metastability. Also
    try different clock frequency''s.

    In case of metastability the dot of the 7 segment display should change its state.
