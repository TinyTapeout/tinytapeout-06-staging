  description: Drives a WS2812B LED strip with random colors for each refresh
  discord: ciro6942
  doc_link: https://github.com/ccattuto/tt05-rng-ws2812b-strip/blob/main/README.md
  external_hw: WS2812B strip of arbitrary lengthd
  how_it_works: 'This project drives a strip of WS2812B RGB LEDs, periodically updating
    the strip with random color values. The project consists of three main modules:

    - a [linear feedback 16-bit shift register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register)
    to generate a stream of pseudo-random bits

    - a 5-bit synchronous increasing counter, wrapping to 0 when the counter reaches
    25. WHen driven by a 20 MHz clock source, the counter generates the 1.25 us pulses
    required by the [WS2812B protocol](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf).
    The duration of the high phase of the pulse is controlled by the random bit stream
    generated above.

    - a 16-bit ripple counter increasing at the end of each pulse, used to divide
    the pulse frequency and generate the LED strip refresh signal

    '
  how_to_test: 'Set the clock frequency to 20 MHz and connect OUT2 to the DIN signal
    of a WS2812B LED strip. Optionally connect to IN6 the DOUT signal of the last
    LED of the strip. Press and release the reset button. The strip should light up
    with random colors, updating at a frequency controllable using the SW3 and SW4
    switches.
