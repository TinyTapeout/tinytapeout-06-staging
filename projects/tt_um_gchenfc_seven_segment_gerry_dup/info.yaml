  how_it_works: 'Uses a counter to display names on a 7-segment display.


    A clock divider slows down the segments to 1 per second (default) as in the 7-segment
    counter template project.  The bottom 8-bits of the counter are output on the
    bidirectional outputs.

    The bottom-5 bits of the dedicated inputs define how fast the clock divider is:
    if non-zero, this formula is used for the wraparound value of the divider: {ui_in[4:2],
    18''b0, ui_in[1:0]}.

    Setting the input to 0bxxx00001 will therefore have clock divider of 1 (i.e. match
    the clock) so that a manual debounced push-button can be used in place of the
    clock.


    Each second, one letter of a name is displayed.  The top 3-bits of the dedicated
    inputs define which name is displayed.

    '
  how_to_test: 'After reset, a new letter should displayed each second with a 10MHz
    input clock.

    Changing the 3 MSB of the input should change which name is displayed.

    Changing the 5 LSB of the input should change how quickly the letters are updated.
