  how_it_works: "Used to multiply a vector by a matrix. The matrix is initially filled\
    \ with all zeros, but can be set to 0s by\nthe user. The first input switch, when\
    \ flipped, will initialize a matrix multiplication between the current set\nvector\
    \ and the empty matrix. If the user wants to set the matrix, it can done line\
    \ by line using the second bit.\nFlipping the second bit causes the current 6\
    \ right most bits to be set to a certain value in the matrix. NO current \nfunctionality\
    \ to know which row of the matrix is set\n"
  how_to_test: 'After reset, the counter should increase by one every second with
    a 10MHz input clock.

    Experiment by changing the inputs to change the counting speed.
