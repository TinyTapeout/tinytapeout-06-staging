  how_it_works: "This project emulates a two-layer neural network using a series of\
    \ integrate and fire neurons defined in Verilog. The neurons accumulate incoming\
    \ spikes and when their cummulative signal surpasses a defined threshold, they\
    \ generate a spike and reset their potential.\n\nThe network is composed of two\
    \ neuron layers. The first input layer accepts two 16-bit inputs, corresponding\
    \ to external stimuli or current, which the neurons of the first layer will processes.\
    \ Based on the internal states of these neurons, they may or may not fire to generate\
    \ spikes. \n\nThe spikes that are generated from the first layer are used as input\
    \ to the second layer. In this model, a spike is defined asw a binary high signal,\
    \ translated into a 16-bit value to mimic the input current standard. If there\
    \ is no spike, there is no input current (zero).\n\nThe second layer defines the\
    \ neural network's output. Each neuron in the second layer may generate a spike,\
    \ which is represented again with a bit. \n"
  how_to_test: "Testing involves applying different input stimuli (current) and observing\
    \ spiking states.\n\nBy changing the values of 'input1' and 'input2', and observing\
    \ the output layers, we can observe different spiking outputs from the neural\
    \ network.  \n"
  inputs:
  - input1[15:0]: 16-bit stimulus input to the first layer's first neuron.
  - input2[15:0]: 16-bit stimulus input to the first layer's second neuron.
  - clk: Clock signal.
  - rst_n: Reset signal; when low, it resets the neurons' current and output spikes.
  language: Verilog
  outputs:
  - output_layer2[1]: Spiking status of the first neuron in the second layer
  - output_layer2[0]: Spiking status of the second neuron in the second layer
