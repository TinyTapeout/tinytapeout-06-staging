  how_it_works: "increments seconds Counter for 60 sec.\nincrements min Counter for\
    \ 60 min. \nincrements hour counter for 12 hours\n\nall daisy chained.\n\nThe\
    \ LEDs will show the hour and the last 15min increment\n"
  how_to_test: "connect leds to each output pin as described below\n\nRST will set\
    \ the time to 11:59. \n\nInput Pins 7/8 are used to set the time, by toggling\
    \ those it should increment the internal clock by 1 min/hour. You should see the\
    \ hour output update immediately.\nThe min output will only change once the next\
    \ 15min increment passes\n\nInput Pin 1 will stop the clock when high\n"
  inputs:
  - none
  - stop the clock
  - none
  - none
  - none
  - none
  - increment min counter by 1
  - increment hour counter by 1
