  description: A circuit to output latin characters on a 7-segment display

  how_it_works: "This project displays a user-selctable character on the 7-segment\
    \ display. Input DIPs 1-6 are used to select the character to display. \nInputs\
    \ 7 and 8 are not connected. The display is driven one segment at a time, so a\
    \ high clock rate is required to see thew character.\nCharacters are a mix of\
    \ upper and lower case, preferring whichever is more recognizable. See the wikipedia\
    \ page on 7-segment display representations\nfor reference [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display_character_representations].\n"
  how_to_test: 'Connect the clock line to the ocillator (or press the clock button
    REALLY fast). Then, use thew DIP switches to enter a 6-digit binary number corresponding

    to the character to be displayed. 0-25 for a-z, then 26:[space], 27:[_], 28:[-],
    29:[.], 30:[!], 31:["]. If only one segment is displayed, make sure your clock
    is set properly!
