  how_it_works: 'Apply an input current injection to the LIF neuron.

    This will modify a neuron membrane potential, and with sufficient current injection,
    will cause periodic action potentials.

    '
  how_to_test: "After reset, all state variables will be initialized. A minimum of\
    \ 2 clock cycles of reset is needed.\n\nAn 8-bit input current is then applied\
    \ to uio_in. The current is treated as the LSB of a 16-bit signal by concatenating\
    \ 8x0's to the front.\nThe first bit is a sign bit, the following 8-bits are treated\
    \ as the whole number while the final 7-bits are the fraction.\nThe current is\
    \ interpreted in dimensions of uA/cm^2.\nThis means the maximum value that can\
    \ be represented is 1.992 uA/cm^2.\n\nThe membrane potential of the neuron will\
    \ respond accordingly. Larger currents will elicit more firing. \nSimulations\
    \ show that the neuron will start firing, reach a steady state where it stops\
    \ firing in absence of input stimulus, and start firing again if the current exceeds\
    \ approximately 8'b00001100 = 8'd12.\n"
