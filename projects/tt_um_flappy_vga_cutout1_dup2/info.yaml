  description: A simple flappy bird clone with a button input and 640x480 VGA output.
    25MHz clock required.

  external_hw: Some kind of VGA adapter needed. Compatible with Tiny VGA PMOD. Also
    needs a debounced button that goes low when pressed on ui_in[0].
  how_it_works: 'There are three main modules in the design. The vgaControl module
    takes in the clock and outputs the horizontal and vertical sync signals, and provides
    the current pixel coordinate to the bitGen module. The gameControl module takes
    the button input and updates the game state (bird position, pipe position, hole
    position, score, etc) each frame. The bitGen module takes in the game state and
    pixel coordinate and outputs the color that the current pixel should be.

    '
  how_to_test: 'The clock input should be set to 25MHz (or 25.179MHz, either should
    be close enough). ui_in[0] should be connected to a debounced button that goes
    low when pressed. The VGA output is compatible with the Tiny VGA PMOD (https://tinytapeout.com/specs/pinouts/).
    Once everything is connected, a reset may need to be triggered before normal operation.
    An image with a yellow square, green pillars, and blue background should appear.
    Pressing the button should cause the bird to flap and start moving towards the
    pipes. The goal is to go through the gap in the pipes. Your score will count up
    in binary on the bidirectional pins each time you successfully make it through
    a pipe.
