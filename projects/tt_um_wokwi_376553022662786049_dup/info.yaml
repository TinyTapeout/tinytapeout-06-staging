  bidirectional:
  - D0  OUTPUT from a 1-bit FF
  - D7 OUTPUT from (1x3x3) cluster
  - D1 OUTPUT from the (5X5) cluster
  - D2 OUTPUT from (6x6x6) cluster
  - D3 OUTPUT from (6x6x6) cluster
  - D4 connected as an OUTPUT pin from either the (6x6x6) cluster or the (1x3x2x1)
    cluster (where IN3 is the input select pin)
  - D5 INPUT to the (6x6x6) cluster
  - D6 INPUT to the (6x6x6) cluster

  description: ' Information is encoded as a sequence of events or spikes in neuro-inspired
    computing. Investigating how information is represented and processed as spike
    trains is of particular interest. This chip implements several test clusters featuring
    various spike trains. '

  how_it_works: "The input clock is connected with the inputs of the neuron clusters.\
    \ The bi-directional pins are provided where external input stimulus could be\
    \ provided. The raster spiking plots are generated to observe the variability\
    \ of different spiking neuron clusters. \n"
  how_to_test: 'Provide input clock frequencies to the neuron clusters and observe
    the output through the oscilloscope.
