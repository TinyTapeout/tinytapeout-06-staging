  description: A series of NOT gates with whip outs to measure self oscillation, and
    a clock switch

  how_it_works: There are two functional blocks - a ring oscillator with multiple
    taps, and a glitchless clock switch.
  how_to_test: To test the oscillator - Input 0 is input to first inverter in the
    oscillator. One of the inverted outputs either 0 (slowest), 1 (mid), or 2 (fastest)
    should be connected to input 0. To test the clock switch - input 1 selects between
    clock0 (on input 2) and clock 1 (on input 3). Selected CLK appears on OUT3
  inputs:
  - 0 Osc In
  - 1 ClkSel
  - 2 CLK0 in
  - 3 Clk1 in
