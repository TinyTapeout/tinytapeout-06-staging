  description: A Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron that mimics the biological neuron
    and is configurable from the outside world

  how_it_works: 'The state machine first configures the different parameters of the
    neuron which is then provided a synaptic current to read out the membrane potential
    and spiking of the neuron.


    The configurable parameters of the neuron are: 1) beta (which controls the decay
    of the membrane potential) 2) threshold (which is used in comparison with the
    membrane potential to generate a spike)


    Initially, the neuron is in an IDLE state where everything remains 0. Upon configuring
    the setting bits with `uio_in[7:1]` the state goes to BETA where the `beta` value
    of the neuron is configured using the `ui_in[7:0]` bits. After which the setting
    bits is again configured to make the state go

    to THRESH state which configures the threshold value of the neuron. Finally, the
    setting bits are used to go to the READ state and the current injection is provided
    with `ui_in` where the neuron starts to integrate the current onto the membrane
    potential.


    At each timestep, the membrane potential is analyzed with `uo_out[7:0]` and the
    spike is outputted through `uio_out[0]`.

    '
  how_to_test: "After reset, the neuron is in the idle state and remains there unless\
    \ the setting bits are configured. Setting the `uio_in[7:1]` bits to 1 changes\
    \ the state to BETA. After configuring the beta value changing the setting bits\
    \ to 2 takes to the THRESH state where the threshold of \nthe neuron is configured.\
    \ Then changing the setting bits to 3 takes to the READ state where the current\
    \ is integrated and the membrane potential changes as well as the spike is outputted\
    \ if the membrane potential becomes equal or greater than the configured threshold.\n\
    \nExperiment by changing the beta, threshold and input current values to see how\
    \ the neuron reacts.\n"
