  how_it_works: 'Apply an input current injection to the LIF neuron using switches.


    This gets added to a membrane potential which is decayed over time.

    If the membrane potential exceeds the threshold then trigger a spike.

    '
  how_to_test: 'After reset, the membrane potential will be set to 0.


    Then change the inputs to change the current. A higher current should

    trigger a higher firing rate.
