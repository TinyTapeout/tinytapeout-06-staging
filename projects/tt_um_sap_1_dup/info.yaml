  how_it_works: "Originally, Malvino and Brown presented the SAP-1 architecture in\
    \ a book called Digital Computer Electronics. \nThe design gained massive popularity\
    \ when it was build as a bread board computer by Ben Eater on a series of YouTube\
    \ videos. \nThe architecture contains various modules, including\n- Clock \n-\
    \ Program Counter\n- Register A\n- Register B\n- Adder\n- Memory\n- Instruction\
    \ Register\n- Bus\n- Controller\nThis design doesn't have inputs, it is dependent\
    \ only on the clock that coordinates sequence of the computer's operation. \n\
    Its operation consists on the communication that that bus provides between modules;\
    \ the signal load dumps information into a module\nand the enable signal allows\
    \ the bus to receive a signal. The bus is 8-bit width since it is an 8 bit computer,\
    \ and the registers\nare also 8-bit registers. \nThe computer can only perform\
    \ addition, whether it is positive numbers or negative numbers (substraction).\
    \ \nThe signals information is stored within the memory module. There bus operations\
    \ are coordinated with a series of multiplexers and      \nthe instruction execution\
    \ set gives the SAP-1 a total of six stages from 0 to 5, repeating all over again.\
    \ \nThe more important module      is the controller. It controlls the assertion\
    \ execution according to the stimuli from the stages.\nThe stages 3 to 5 five\
    \ depend on the instructions of the operation codes. \n"
  how_to_test: "Design Output Reading Section\nThe design is engineered to read the\
    \ output signal generated from the bus, which contains the information \nof the\
    \ add and subtract operations executed by the design. Currently, the only method\
    \ to read the signals \nis through an oscilloscope. However, a significant enhancement\
    \ would be the implementation of a state machine \ncontrolling a 3 7-segment display\
    \ to show the numbers on the 8-bit bus (up to 255).\n"
