  how_it_works: "A Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron is a simple mathematical\
    \ model used in \nneuroscience and computational neuroscience to describe the\
    \ behavior of individual neurons. \nIt provides a simplified yet effective way\
    \ to simulate the behavior of real neurons. In the\nneuron, there are two key\
    \ elements: the current and the threshold. If the current surpasses\nthe threshold,\
    \ a spike is emitted, otherwise, the spike is 0 (resting). In this spiking LSTM\
    \ \nimplementation, the neuron's threshold is adaptive, and will increase when\
    \ the threshold is\npassed. When the neuron fails to reach the threshold, it will\
    \ slowy decay back to the initial\nthreshold.  \n"
  how_to_test: 'After applying the reset, the variables should be initialized, and
    a current can be applied.

    The testbench will record the current, threshold, and spiking behavior of the
    neuron.

    When a higher current is applied, you can see how the threshold increases, and
    vice versa when

    a spike is not emitted.
