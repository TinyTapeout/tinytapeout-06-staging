  how_it_works: "Reads from two 8-bit input and creates a weighted sum  \nof the 16\
    \ bits.\n\nThe 8-bit wieights are default 10000000 and are unuptatable.\n(10000000\
    \ represents 0.5 if the you conceptualize a . on the far left\nor represents 128\
    \ if you conceptualize a . on the far right)\n\nIf the weighted sum is greater\
    \ than the threshold, 11111110, than it\nwill classify the input as 1 otherwise\
    \ it will classify it as 0.\n\n9 + 10 = 21\n\nCredit/Thanks to my Professor: UCSC's\

  how_to_test: "Any input with all 0's should be classified as 0.\n\nMath: \n\nNote:\
    \ The threshold is 11111110 which can be thought of as 0.99993896484\n\nw0*i0\

    \ fifteen 0's and one 1's should be classified as 0.\n\nMath: \n\nw0*i0 + w1*i1\
