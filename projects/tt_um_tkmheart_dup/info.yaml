  description: The design integrates a threshold-based filtering mechanism followed
    by peak detection on the filtered data.

  how_it_works: 'The peak detection module implements a peak detection circuit that
    checks for the occurrence of a peak in the input data stream over three consecutive
    clock cycles. The threshold filtering module is a threshold filter that processes
    the input data based on the threshold and higher flag, and then passes it to the
    peak detection module. The clock divider module divides the input clock signal
    by 2 to generate a new clock signal clk2.

    Example: setting the inputs to 00010000 will program 16384 into the compare register.

    With a 10MHz clock the counter will increment ~610 times per second.

    '
  how_to_test: 'Keep the reset at 0 for two clock pulses. Change the reset to 1. Set
    the threshold pin to 1 and send the lower four bits first. Set the higher pin
    to 1 and send the higher four bits. Switch the threshold to 0. Alternate between
    sending the lower and higher four bits as inputs.
