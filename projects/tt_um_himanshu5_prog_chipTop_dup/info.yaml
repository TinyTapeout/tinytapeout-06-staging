  how_it_works: 'The project has two compute unit which perform some ALU operations
    based on input instructions and the final output

    is xor of compute unit output.

  how_to_test: "Reset needs to be 0 to make design go to reset mode and then set reset\
    \ to 1 and ena to 1 to shift the design to \nfunctional mode. I tested my design\
    \ on EDA playground by creating testbench there. Testbench and design files are\n\
    there in test/ directory.\n"
