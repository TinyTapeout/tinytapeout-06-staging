  how_it_works: 'Eight D flip flops chained together count the clock input and use
    the 8 outputs to represent the binary value. The counter lacks

    useful features like a deterministic initial state or a reset function. This was
    constructed during the Hackaday Supercon 2023 ASIC

    workshop as a rapid learning exercise.
