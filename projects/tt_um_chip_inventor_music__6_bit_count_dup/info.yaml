  how_it_works: 'There are two diagrams created by the Chip Inventor platform, whereas
    by using blocks, you can create your own semiconductor design.

    The piano tune is one diagram. A song-throwing buzzer can be configured with one
    button and a buzzer.

    A 6-bit counter diagram is the other.

  how_to_test: 'Using a buzzer, it''s possible to listen to a music note.

    Connecting 4 LEDs in pull_up makes it possible to see the binary value.
