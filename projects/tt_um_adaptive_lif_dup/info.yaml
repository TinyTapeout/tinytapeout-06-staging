  how_it_works: "When a LIF (Leaky - Integrate and Fire) neuron integrates enough\
    \ current stimulation, \nit will be activated and Fire once spike. This current\
    \ is introduced by the 8-bit chip input pin, but while integrating, \nthe LIF\
    \ neuron gradually loses the previously accumulated current like an hourglass,\
    \ \nso it is called Leaky. this module implements this biological behavior with\
    \ a mathematical equation. \nThe state of the neuron can be monitored externally\
    \ through the 8-bit chip output pins.\n\nThe LIF neuron module also includes adaptive\
    \ threshold and adaptive decay rate to \ndynamically adjust its own fire threshold\
    \ or decay rate. The adaptive threshold can be enabled by \nsetting bit 0 of the\
    \ bidirectional IO, and the adaptive decay rate can be enabled by setting bit\
    \ 1 of the bidirectional IO. \nsimulations show that this allows the LIF neuron\
    \ to enhance the sparsity of spikes while preserving the input features, \nwhich\
    \ improves the efficiency of the chip.\n"
  how_to_test: "LIF neurons will receive current inputs in three different gears (strong,\
    \ medium, and weak). \nThe spike rate should be higher when the current is stronger\
    \ and lower when the current is weaker. \nAfter turning on adaptive threshold\
    \ and adaptive decay rate the chip needs to retain this feature \nwhile trying\
    \ to enhance sparsity to avoid neurons that fire frequently or not at all, \n\
    to make it consistent with realistic biological characteristics.\n"
