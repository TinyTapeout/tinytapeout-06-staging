  description: Taking in the number of curves and edges of a number, the output is
    the expected number.

  how_it_works: 'Takes in a 7 bit input, with the 3 leftmost bits being the number
    of edges of a number, and the other bits are the numbers of curves in the number.

    The output has 8 bits, separated into two halves the first half is the output
    of the perceptron, and the second half is the output of the binary neural network.

    '
  how_to_test: 'After reset, the counter should increase by one every second with
    a 10MHz input clock.

    Experiment by changing the inputs to change the counting speed.
