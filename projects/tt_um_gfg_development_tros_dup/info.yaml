  description: Three different ring oscillator, with different temperature dependence
  discord: liggi.iggil
  doc_link: ''
  external_hw: ''
  how_it_works: "This design implements three different ring oscillators. The first\
    \ one is a basic NAND \nbased oscillator. The second one adds additional NAND\
    \ gates to the outputs of the stages\nof the oscillator to increase the capacitve\
    \ loading. The last one uses the tri-state\ninverts with a sub-threshold tri-state\
    \ enable. \n\nFor measuring the frequencies each oscillator is driving a counter.\
    \ This counters are\nlatched with the latch counter input. With the input transfer\
    \ counter the currently \nselected counter (counter select bits) is transfered\
    \ via the serial data stream. The \ntransfer is driven by the clock of the design.\
    \ As encoding a manchester encoding is used. \n\nFurthermore, a divided version\
    \ of the clock of each oscillator is outputted. The divisior\ncan be configured\
    \ with the frequency selection bits. \n"
