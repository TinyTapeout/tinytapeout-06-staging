  how_it_works: "Current-based LIF neurons are a simplified abstraction of the behavior\
    \ of real neurons,\nand they are often used in large-scale neural network simulations\
    \ due to their computational efficiency.\nThese models are useful for studying\
    \ the dynamics of spiking neurons and their role in information \nprocessing in\
    \ the brain.\n"
  how_to_test: 'To test the current-based LIF project, follow these steps: Connect
    the LIF module to the input switches,

    7-segment display, and clock source as specified in the Verilog module. Use input
    switches to control the

    input current, and observe the 7-segment display for spike detection, while ensuring
    the clock signal is appropriately set to provide the desired clock frequency for
    the simulation.
