  how_it_works: 'This project implements a bounded spigot algorithm for calculating
    the digits (currently 31) of e. While there are many ways to calculate the digits
    of transcendental numbers like e or pi, this spigot algorithm has much lower memory
    requirements. It however only produces a single digit at a time, and the number
    of digits produced is precommited at the time of design. For calculating n digits,
    the algorithm needs at least (n+1) storage locations. Each digit requires (n+1)
    calculation steps, repeated (n-1) times producing (n-1) digits (first digit 2
    is not counted). Each calculation step requires a constant multiply, an add and
    a divide with remainder.

    There are many optimizations needed to fit as many digits as possible into a 1x1
    tile. The biggest contributor is the storage elements. Some quick modeling revealed
    that the storage elements need to be about as wide as log(n).

    The calculation step hardware is shared across all iterations.

    The intermediate results are never needed outside each calculation and are never
    stored in memory.

    The memory access is such that each location is read and written to before moving
    on to the next.

    The memory access pattern removes the need for address decoding, replaced with
    a massive ring of gated shift registers.

  how_to_test: 'The digits are output on the bidirectional port and the output port
    in BCD (Binary-coded decimal). A BCD to seven segment decoder will be needed to
    display the digits. A clock below 500Hz should allow one to see the digits slide
    across the segment displays.
