  doc_link: https://github.com/WallieEverest/tt05/blob/main/README.md
  external_hw: Computer COM port
  how_it_works: 'ChipTune implements an 8-bit Programmable Sound Generator (PSG).

    Input is from a serial UART interface.

    Output is PWM audio.


    # Overview

    This project replicates the Audio Processing Unit (APU) of vintage video games.


    # Statistics

    - Tiles: 1x2

    - DFF: 458

    - Total Cells: 2760

    - Utilization: 72%


    # TinyTapeout 5 Configuration

    TT04 devices from the eFabless Multi-Project Wafer (MPW) shuttle are delivered
    in QFN-64 packages, mounted on a daughterboard for breakout.


    Based on data from:

    - https://github.com/WallieEverest/tt04


    Changes:

    1.) Static registers addressed by the serial UART have been connected to the external
    reset, providing a known startup.

    2.) Default values for REG signals have been removed, allowing ''X'' propagation
    during simulation until the design reaches steady state.

    '
  how_to_test: 'The ChipTune project can be interfaced to a computer COM port (9600,n,8,1).

    An analog PWM filter and audio driver are needed for the test rig.
